# üöÄ RAG-Automate-MSP

Houstan, we don't have a problem. Command Center AI has it under control.

Welcome to **RAG-Automate-MSP**! This project is your mission control for automating project rocket MSP software using a RAG (Retrieve and Generate) model. Get ready to launch into seamless service management across the galaxy! üåå

## üå† Features

- **Automated Service Management**: Streamline operations across your MSPs like a well-oiled space station.
- **Smart Data Retrieval**: Efficiently gather data from various sources like a cosmic explorer. üåç
- **AI-Powered Responses**: Generate precise and context-aware responses faster than the speed of light. ‚ö°
- **Customizable Workflows**: Configure automation tailored to your interstellar business needs. üõ†Ô∏è

## üõ∏ Getting Started

Embark on your automation journey with these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RAG-Automate-MSP.git
    ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. **Install LangChain**:
    ```bash
    pip install langchain
    ```
4. **Configure Your MSP Settings**:
    - Update the `config.yaml` file with your service provider details. Customize it for your cosmic fleet.
5. **Run the Model**:
    ```bash
    python run_model.py
    ```

## üåå Demo

Check out our [live demo](#) to witness the model in action! Watch as it deftly navigates the complexities of managing multiple services across the galaxy. üì°

## üåå How It Works

Our model harnesses the power of cutting-edge AI to pilot your MSP operations:

1. **Retrieve**: Gather vital data from your various service providers, just like collecting space dust.
2. **Analyze**: Use the RAG model

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn-pages-router) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.
